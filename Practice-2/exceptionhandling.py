'''
Python Errors and Built-in Exceptions
These errors can be broadly classified into two classes:
1.	Syntax errors
2.	Logical errors (Exceptions)

Python Syntax Errors
Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language is called syntax error or parsing error.

Python Logical Errors (Exceptions)
Errors that occur at runtime (after passing the syntax test) are called exceptions or logical errors.
